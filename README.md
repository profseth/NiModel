# NiModel
Code used to build a global Ni biogeochemical cycling model.

These functions are designed to be run within the AWESOME OCIM modeling environment (https://github.com/profseth/awesomeOCIM) (John et al. 2020), and require fields of particulate Mn (van Hulten et al. 2017) and Th and Pa (van Hulten et al. 2018) which can be re-gridded from the model output provided by van Hulten, or provided in the OCIM grid upon request.

Note that the model also presents results using the AO native function revscavPOC.
